# A new start, inspired by a neat tool

> Arise is a static site generator written in Bash, designed to be a fusion of ultra-stable 90s technology and modern DevOps paradigms. Arise is designed around use cases like individual blogs and personal websites.

That's the stock blurb from this page, but now I'm speaking for myself. I haven't had a website for myself for a few decades but I've been working with computers all my life, with linux much of my life, and in hosting for a few years now. I used to know HTML, I know a little about git, and nothing about CI/CD or cloud services so Arise seems like a perfect match for me. I get to refresh my old HTML skills, and learn some modern devops practices as well.

This page is hosted with Cloudflare, built with Github actions. Pages are written in Markdown, and I'm trying out <a href="https://surge.sh/" target="_blank">surge.sh</a> for staging. 

The theme began as the stock Arise theme and many aspects of that remain. I've been adjusting things though, and almost certainly will continue. 

02/12/25 - As of today, not much of the stock theme remains. It was an excellent start.
