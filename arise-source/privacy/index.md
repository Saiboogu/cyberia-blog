# Privacy Information

02/15/25 - This section applied from site launch until today:
This page is hosted with Cloudflare Pages, so it is subject to whatever data collection they choose to do. I will likely investigate other options in the future, but for now it's on Cloudflare on purpose. I am not using any of Cloudflare's Javascript tracking, only log analytics. 

02/15/25 - From now until noted otherwise:
This page is hosted with Amazon AWS Amplify, so it is subject to whatever data collection they choose to do. I will likely investigate other options in the future, but for now it's on AWS on purpose (I'm exploring cloud providers for experience). 

I am using self hosted <a href="https://plausible.io/self-hosted-web-analytics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plausible</a> analytics. There are no cookies, and no private data storage. Some pages have comments, using a self hosted <a href="https://cusdis.com/doc#/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cusdis</a> commenting system. Cusdis does not use cookies either. Plausible and Cusdis are both hosted in my home, in America. Both anonymized analytics and comments containing whatever information you submit will be retained indefinitely, but contact me if you wish to remove a comment. 

# Analytics

This is exactly what I see from Analytics.
