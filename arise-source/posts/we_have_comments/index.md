Bit of a "Build it, and they (might) come (eventually). That's fine, this is all practice and education.

I thought I would toss something like Disqus on here, but I remembered to search "self hosted" first and found [Cusdis](https://github.com/djyde/cusdis). I tried their hosted version just long enough to see it was workable, then put up a self hosted instance so I could dig in and start tweaking it. 

Had to tweak the iframe heigth already, it was claustrophobically short and I didn't like the CSS hacks I was using to try and make it taller from Arise instead of Cusdis.
