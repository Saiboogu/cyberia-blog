# New Logo -- For Now

I dug the style of the [Arise logo](arise_logo.png){:target="_blank"}, but certainly couldn't just keep using it. I mean, the license allows for it, but it would be a bit unoriginal of me, right? 

So I fired up Inkscape for the first time ever, and discovered [DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/){:target="_blank"}, and got to work. It's OK for a start - but expect it to change. (And hopefully for the better!)

And of course, a new logo includes a new name - Though I'm not certain of it, not entirely. But again, it's a start. 

So, with that incredibly enthusiastic explanation out of the way -- Welcome to Cyberia!
