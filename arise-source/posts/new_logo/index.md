# New Logo -- For Now (and already retired)

1/20 Original Post - 

I dug the style of the <a href="arise_logo.png" target="_blank">Arise logo</a>, but certainly couldn't just keep using it. I mean, the license allows for it, but it would be a bit unoriginal of me, right? 

So I fired up Inkscape for the first time ever, and discovered <a href="https://www.dafont.com/" target="_blank">DaFont</a> and got to work. It's OK for a start - but expect it to change. (And hopefully for the better!)

And of course, a new logo includes a new name - Though I'm not certain of it, not entirely. But again, it's a start. 

So, with that incredibly enthusiastic explanation out of the way -- Welcome to Cyberia!

1/29 Update - I never was too happy with that logo, and quickly retired it. New-new logo is ascii-art and CSS, and a work in progress but already an improvement in my eyes. Here's the old-new logo for posterity:
