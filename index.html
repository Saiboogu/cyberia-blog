is designed around use cases like individual blogs and personal
websites.</p>

<p>That’s the stock blurb from this page, but now I’m speaking for
myself. I haven’t had a website for myself for a few decades but I’ve
been working with computers all my life, with linux much of my life, and
in hosting for a few years now. I used to know HTML, I know a little
about git, and nothing about CI/CD or cloud services so Arise seems like
a perfect match for me. I get to refresh my old HTML skills, and learn
some modern devops practices as well.</p>
<p>02/12/25 - I underestimated CSS. Fortunately, I’m having fun figuring
it out better.</p>
<p>This page is hosted with Cloudflare (02/15/25 - Now AWS Amplify),
built with Github actions. Pages are written in Markdown, and I’m trying
out <a href="https://surge.sh/" target="_blank">surge.sh</a> for
staging.</p>
<p>The theme began as the stock Arise theme and many aspects of that
remain. I’ve been adjusting things though, and almost certainly will
continue.</p>
<p>02/12/25 - As of today, not much of the stock theme remains. It was
an excellent start.</p>
