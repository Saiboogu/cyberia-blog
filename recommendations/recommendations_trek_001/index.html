<h1 id="star-trek-youtubers">Star Trek YouTubers</h1>
<p>These past couple years I’ve been spending more time on YouTube,
exploring some real high quality content in a variety of fields. These
days, YouTube has educational and documentary content better than most
anything I’ve seen on broadcast or cable. Today, though, I’ll be
covering some entertainment YouTubers I’m fond of, in particular Star
Trek reviewers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SteveShives" target="_blank">Steve
Shives</a> has a fairly versatile channel featuring politics, Star Trek,
Poirot, Agatha Christie, Atheism, and even … conversations with stuffed
animals? I’m mainly there for the Star Trek, though a political video
headline jumped out at me once when Steve launched into a rant about a
local (to both of us) state representative - fun way to confirm our
politics are well aligned, and to realize that we’re within an hour of
each other.</p>
<p>Like I said, I’m really on his channel for Trek content, though. He’s
done a variety of videos on a wide variety of Trek related topics,
though the mainstay are his “Retro Reviews,” small review series where
he chooses a theme and then reviews a handful of episodes across all
concluded Trek series that fit the theme.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWrYvtW9ZN8&list=PL0-LSnSBNIncf0tkpjOHAorxjsAhLYSW3" target="_blank">The
Retro Reviews</a> playlist starts off with “First Episodes” and if that
doesn’t tickle your fancy I suggest skimming the list and jumping in at
any point you like - there’s nothing lost jumping around.</p>
<p>He’s on my list of irreverent Trek reviewers because he’s quick to
lampshade some of the dumber troppes that Trek sometimes leans on, but
he’s on my list of favorites because not only is the humor on point, he
gets serious where appropriate too, offering insightful thoughts both
about Star Trek’s great social commentary, and semi-regular stumbles -
often down to the era, but always worth acknowledging.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Unlimited_Lives" target="_blank">Unlimited
Lives</a> has less depth and breadth of content, but what he is
producing is a lot of fun, with some excellent commentary. His review
series launched as “Star Trek Reviewed by an Arsehole” but over time
shifted to “Reviewed by a Pedant.” The latter is more fair than the
former, and in reality it’s “Star Trek from a Nuerospicy POV.” The
pedantry is mild and mostly limited to the more egregious faults of
plot, storytelling, or canon consistency and he often manages to present
insightful interpretations of a scene that may or may not have been
intentional, but make the story all the better if you recognize the
possibilities. Every Unlimited Lives review is littered with his own
particular flavor of euphemisms, odd nicknames, and running inside jokes
such as “… because, Tom Paris is a Dick” complete with title card that
comes up every time the phrase gets used. Some of my other favorite bits
are spinning the “Wheel of Names” to rename any significant one-off
character something goofy like Commander Carbon, or the sponsored
renamings of recurring characters that his fans do - giving us such gems
as General Martok, Supreme Commander of the Ninth Fleet, and Chancellor
of the Klingon Empire being renamed aptly to “Martok, Husband of
Sirella.” (iykyk)</p>
<p>So far he’s got two major projects, a completed
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNYoj_gIbqI&list=PL4m7EfBWW-hY-7b2cu0r3BGjwCHyiAeP8" target="_blank">review
series of Voyager</a> covering key episodes of each season as well as
seasonal recaps, and an in-progress series on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxOKgu_f0Uc&list=PL4m7EfBWW-hYIYPTOndYulWmkuJiX1YtE" target="_blank">Deep
Space 9</a>. The first few seasons of Voyager reviews aren’t up to later
levels of detail and analysis, but they’re also more compact and breeze
by quickly. I enjoyed watching the entire series for reminding me of
stories I’d forgotten, filling in ones I’d missed, and a ton of
commentary on things I hadn’t noticed along the way. Deep Space 9 was
launched in the fully refined modern video style, and is up to Season 04
currently.</p>
